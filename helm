Enable Required MicroK8s Add-ons:

bash
Copy code
microk8s.enable dns storage
Install Helm:
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment of applications.

bash
Copy code
sudo snap install helm --classic
Add Bitnami Helm Repository:

bash
Copy code
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
Create Namespace for Moodle:

bash
Copy code
microk8s.kubectl create namespace moodle
Install Moodle using Helm:

bash
Copy code
helm install moodle bitnami/moodle \
  --namespace moodle \
  --set moodleUsername=admin \
  --set moodlePassword=admin-password
Note: Replace admin-password with your desired password.

Wait for Deployment:
Wait for the Moodle deployment to complete. You can check the status using:

bash
Copy code
microk8s.kubectl get pods -n moodle
Wait until the pods are in the "Running" state.

Expose Moodle Service:

bash
Copy code
microk8s.kubectl expose deployment moodle-moodle --type=NodePort --name=moodle-service -n moodle
Access Moodle:
Find the NodePort assigned to the Moodle service:

bash
Copy code
microk8s.kubectl get svc -n moodle moodle-service
Access Moodle using the NodePort in your browser. For example, if the NodePort is 30000, you can access Moodle at http://<your-node-ip>:30000.

Access Moodle Admin Panel:
Access the Moodle admin panel using the provided credentials at http://<your-node-ip>:30000/admin.

Clean Up (Optional):
If you want to uninstall Moodle, you can use:

bash
Copy code
helm uninstall moodle -n moodle
microk8s.kubectl delete namespace moodle
This will remove the Moodle deployment and its associated resources.

Please note that these instructions assume a basic setup, and you might need to adjust configurations based on your specific requirements. Additionally, ensure that your system meets the requirements for running Moodle, such as having sufficient resources (CPU, memory) available.


The error message indicates that MicroK8s is unable to connect to the Kubernetes cluster on the default API server address (http://localhost:8080). This could be due to various reasons. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Check if MicroK8s is Running:
Ensure that MicroK8s is running by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
microk8s.status
If it's not running, start it using:

bash
Copy code
microk8s.start
Check MicroK8s Status:
Run the following command to check the status of MicroK8s components:

bash
Copy code
microk8s.kubectl get nodes
Ensure that the nodes are in a Ready state.

Check kubeconfig File:
MicroK8s uses its own kubeconfig file. Make sure that your KUBECONFIG environment variable is set to the MicroK8s kubeconfig file. It is typically located at ~/.kube/config:

bash
Copy code
export KUBECONFIG=/var/snap/microk8s/current/credentials/kubelet.config
Restart MicroK8s:
Try restarting MicroK8s to see if it resolves the issue:

bash
Copy code
microk8s.stop
microk8s.start
Check for Systemd Service:
Ensure that the MicroK8s systemd service is running:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status snap.microk8s.daemon-kubelet.service
Firewall and Networking:
Ensure that there are no firewall issues blocking communication. Check that the necessary ports (e.g., 8080) are open.

Reinstall MicroK8s:
If the issue persists, you may consider reinstalling MicroK8s. This involves stopping and removing the existing MicroK8s installation and then reinstalling it.

bash
Copy code
microk8s.stop
sudo snap remove microk8s
sudo snap install microk8s --classic
microk8s.start
Check Docker Status:
Ensure that Docker is running, as MicroK8s uses it as a container runtime:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status docker
Check for Resource Availability:
Insufficient system resources (CPU, memory) could lead to connection issues. Make sure your system has enough resources available.

Check for Snap Version Compatibility:
Ensure that you are using a version of MicroK8s that is compatible with your operating system. You can check the MicroK8s releases page for the latest stable version: MicroK8s Releases

After performing these checks, you should be able to connect to the MicroK8s cluster without encountering the "connection refused" error. If the issue persists, you may need to dig deeper into system logs and MicroK8s logs to identify the root cause.
